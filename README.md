# How to use this image?

The above Bold BI image can be deployed using Docker or Docker Compose. In the following section, we are going to start the Bold BI application and a separate PostgreSQL instance with volume mounts for data persistence using Docker Compose.

1. Download the Docker Compose file by using the following command.
   
   ```sh
   curl -o docker-compose.yml "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boldbi/boldbi-docker/main/deploy/single-container-pre-configured/docker-compose.yml"
   ```
2. Open the Docker Compose file, fill in the mandatory field, and save it. You can refer to the guidance provided below for filling in the BOLD_SERVICES_UNLOCK_KEY details.

    ![docker-compose-variable](docs/images/docker-compose-variable.png)

      **BOLD_SERVICES_UNLOCK_KEY Guidance**
      * Refer to [this](https://support.boldbi.com/kb/article/12983/how-to-get-offline-license-key-for-bold-bi) document to get Bold BI unlock key.

3. Run the "docker-compose up -d" command.  
   
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   ![docker-compose-command](docs/images/docker-compose-up.png)

4. After running this command, please check the running status of the Bold BI container by referring to the container logs. The logs will be displayed as shown below upon successful installation of Bold BI.

   ```sh
   docker logs boldbi -f
   ```
   ![docker-boldbi-logs](docs/images/docker-logs.png)

5. Now, access the Bold BI application by entering the URL as `http://localhost:port` or `http://host-ip:port-number` in the browser.

    * For physical and GUI machines, you can use the URL as `http://localhost:8085` or `http://internal-ip-address:8085`. You can obtain the internal IP address by using the `ipconfig` or `ifconfig` command.
    * For virtual machines and non-GUI machines, you can use URL as `http://host-ip:8085` or `http://public-ip:8085`.

   When opening this URL in the browser, it will configure the application startup in the background and display the page below within a few seconds.
